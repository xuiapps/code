# Tessellation

**Xui.Runtime.Software** provides a full software rendering backend that can rasterize vector paths using a scanline-based tessellator.

## Overview

Vector paths (`Xui.Core.Canvas.Path2D`) can be tessellated into triangle polygons for software or GPU-based rendering.

The tessellation pipeline proceeds through these stages:

1. **Flattening**  
   Curves (e.g. B√©zier, arcs) are approximated with straight-line segments based on a flatness threshold.

2. **Contours**  
   Segments are grouped into closed loops, and winding direction is determined for fill rule evaluation.

3. **Scanline Sweep**  
   A vertical scanline algorithm partitions the shape into spans using either **even-odd** or **non-zero** winding rules.

4. **Triangulation**  
   The spans are tessellated into individual triangles for rasterization.

### üíñ Example: Heart Shape Tessellation

```csharp
var path = new Path2D();
path.MoveTo(new Point(60, 20));
path.CurveTo(new Point(100, 0), new Point(100, 60), new Point(60, 80));
path.CurveTo(new Point(20, 60), new Point(20, 0), new Point(60, 20));
path.ClosePath();

// Perform tessellation using even-odd fill rule
var result = PathTesselator.Fill(path, FillRule.EvenOdd);

// Access the generated triangle polygons
foreach (var triangle in result.Polygons)
{
    // Use triangle.A, triangle.B, triangle.C
}
```

### üéØ Curve Flattening Precision

The tessellator uses **curve flattening** to convert B√©zier paths into line segments. You can control the precision with a `flatness` parameter:

```csharp
var tess = PathTesselator.Fill(path, FillRule.EvenOdd, flatness: 0.25f);
```

### üü¢ Example: "O" Shape with Hole (Even-Odd Fill)

This example demonstrates how the tessellator handles holes using the **even-odd** fill rule. The path includes two closed loops: an outer circle and an inner circle forming the hole.

```csharp
var path = new Path2D();

// Outer circle
path.MoveTo(new Point(60, 20));
path.CurveTo(new Point(100, 20), new Point(100, 80), new Point(60, 80));
path.CurveTo(new Point(20, 80), new Point(20, 20), new Point(60, 20));
path.ClosePath();

// Inner circle (hole)
path.MoveTo(new Point(60, 35));
path.CurveTo(new Point(75, 35), new Point(75, 65), new Point(60, 65));
path.CurveTo(new Point(45, 65), new Point(45, 35), new Point(60, 35));
path.ClosePath();

var result = PathTesselator.Fill(path, FillRule.EvenOdd);

foreach (var triangle in result.Polygons)
{
    // triangle.A, triangle.B, triangle.C
}
```

### üï≥Ô∏è Holes and the Non-Zero Fill Rule

When using the **non-zero** fill rule, holes are only excluded if their winding direction cancels out the outer contour. In the example below, both the outer and inner circles are wound in the same direction, so the hole is not excluded ‚Äî the entire shape is filled.

To produce holes reliably, the **even-odd** fill rule is often preferred for paths with overlapping or nested contours.

### ‚àû Example: Figure-8 with Self-Intersecting Path

This shape is a single continuous path that loops back on itself to form a twisted ‚Äú8‚Äù structure ‚Äî like a flattened M√∂bius strip. The fill rule affects whether the middle crossing cancels or doubles the fill.

- **Even-Odd** creates two distinct lobes with a canceling center.
- **Non-Zero** fills the entire structure due to cumulative winding.

### ‚úÖ Summary

The Xui tessellation system provides a precise and flexible pipeline for flattening, contour analysis, fill rule evaluation, and triangle generation. This enables fast and reliable vector shape rendering in both software and hardware pipelines, with support for edge cases like self-intersecting paths and holes.

Use `PathTesselator.Fill(...)` with the fill rule that best matches your layout or rendering intent ‚Äî and enjoy pixel-perfect cross-platform rendering with Xui!
